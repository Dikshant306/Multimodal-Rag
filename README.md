# Multimodal-Rag
I built a multimodal RAG system using CLIP and GPT-4o to suggest flower bouquets based on text or images. CLIP interprets visual input to retrieve relevant styles, while GPT-4o generates personalized, context-aware suggestions. It blends visual and textual cues, ideal for florists, events, and design recommendations.
